# TLSphinx

TLSphinx is a Swift wrapper around [Pocketsphinx], a portable library based on [CMU Sphinx], that allow an application to perform speech recognition **without the audio ever leaving the device**

This repository has two main parts. The first is a syntetized version of the [pocketsphinx](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/pocketsphinx/5prealpha/) and [sphinx base] repositories with a module map to access the library as a [Clang module]. This module is accessed under the name `Shpinx` and has two submodules: `Pocket` and `Base` in reference to _pocketsphinx_ and _sphinx base_.

The second part is `TLSphinx`, a Swift framework that uses the `Sphinx` Clang module and exposes a Swift-like API that talks to _pocketsphinx_.

_Note: I write a blog post about `TLSphinx` [here](http://blog.tryolabs.com/2015/06/15/tlsphinx-automatic-speech-recognition-asr-in-swift/) at the [Tryolabs Blog]. Check it out for a short history about why I wrote this._

## Usage

The framework provides three classes:
- `Config` describe the configuration needed to recognize speech.
- `Decoder` is the main class that provides the API to perform all decoding.
- `Hypotesis` is the result of a decode attempt. It has a `text` and a `score` properties.

#### Config

Represents the _cmd_ln_t_ opaque structure in `Sphinx`. The default constructor takes an array of tuples with the form `(param name, param value)` where _"param name"_ is the name of one of the parameters recognized by `Sphinx`. In this example we are passing the acustic model, the language model and the dictionary. For a complete list of recognized parameters check the [Sphinx docs].

The class has a public property to turn on/off the debug info from `Sphinx`:
```swift
public var showDebugInfo: Bool
```

#### Decoder

Represent the _ps_decoder_t_ opaque struct in `Sphinx`. The default constructor take a `Config` object as parameter.

This has the functions to perform the decode from a file or from the mic. The result is returned in an optional `Hypotesis` object, following the naming convention of the _Pocketsphinx_ API. The functions are:

To decode speech from a file:
```swift
public func decodeSpeechAtPath (filePath: String, complete: (Hypotesis?) -> ())
```
The audio pointed by `filePath` must have the following characteristics:
- single-channel (monaural)
- little-endian
- unheadered
- 16-bit signed
- PCM
- sampled at 16000 Hz

To control the size of the buffer used to read the file, the `Decoder` class has a public property
```swift
public var bufferSize: Int
```

To decode a live audio stream from the mic:
```swift
public func startDecodingSpeech (utteranceComplete: (Hypotesis?) -> ())
public func stopDecodingSpeech ()
```

You can use the same `Decoder` instance many times.

#### Hypotesis

This struct represents the result of a _decode_ attempt. It has a `text` property with the best scored text and a `score` with the score value. This struct implements `Printable` so you can print it with `println(hypotesis_value)`.

### Examples

#### Processing an Audio File

As an example let's see how to decode the speech in an audio file. To do so you first need to create a `Config` object and pass it to the `Decoder` constructor. With the decoder you can perform automatic speech recognition from an audio file like so:

```swift
import TLSphinx

let hmm = ...   // Path to the acustic model
let lm = ...    // Path to the languaje model
let dict = ...  // Path to the languaje dictionary

if let config = Config(args: ("-hmm", hmm), ("-lm", lm), ("-dict", dict)) {
  if let decoder = Decoder(config:config) {
      
      let audioFile = ... // Path to an audio file
      
      decoder.decodeSpeechAtPath(audioFile) {
          
          if let hyp: Hypotesis = $0 {
              // Print the decoder text and score
              println("Text: \(hyp.text) - Score: \(hyp.score)")
          } else {
              // Can't decode any speech because of an error
          }
      }
  } else {
      // Handle Decoder() fail
  }
} else {
  // Handle Config() fail  
}
```
The decode is performed with the `decodeSpeechAtPath` function in the bacground. Once the process finishes,  the `complete` closure is called in the main thread.

#### Speech from the Mic

```swift
import TLSphinx

let hmm = ...   // Path to the acoustic model
let lm = ...    // Path to the language model
let dict = ...  // Path to the language dictionary

if let config = Config(args: ("-hmm", hmm), ("-lm", lm), ("-dict", dict)) {
  if let decoder = Decoder(config:config) {
      
      decoder.startDecodingSpeech {
          
          if let hyp: Hypotesis = $0 {
              println(hyp)
          } else {
              // Can't decode any speech because an error
          }
      }
  } else {
      // Handle Decoder() fail
  }
} else {
  // Handle Config() fail  
}

//At some point in the future stop listen to the mic
decoder.stopDecodingSpeech()

```

## Installation

The easiest way to integrate `TLSphinx` is using [Carthage] or a similar method to get the framework bundle. This lets you integrate the framework and the `Sphinx` module without _magic_.

#### Carthage

In your `Cartfile` add a reference to the last version of `TLSphinx`:
````
github "Tryolabs/TLSphinx" ~> 0.0.4
````

Then run `carthage update`, this should fetch and build the last version of `TLSphinx`. Once it's done, drag the _TLSphinx.framewok_ bundle to the XCode _Linked Frameworks and Libraries_. You must tell XCode where to find `Sphinx` module that is located in the Carthage checkout. To do so:
- add `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Checkouts/TLSphinx/Sphinx/include` to _Header Search Paths_ recursive
- add `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Checkouts/TLSphinx/Sphinx/lib` to _Library Search Paths_ recursive
- in _Swift Compiler - Search Paths_ add `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Checkouts/TLSphinx/Sphinx/include` to _Import Paths_

#### Manual

Download the project from this repository and drag the _TLSpinx_ project to your XCode project. If you encounter any errors about missing headers and/or libraries for _Sphinx_ please add the `Spinx/include` directory to your header search path and `Sphinx/lib` to the library search path and mark it as `recursive`.
